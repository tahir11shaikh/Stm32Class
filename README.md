**Introduction**:
This repository contains a collection of peripheral libraries for STM32 microcontrollers, written in C++. The libraries cover a wide range of peripherals including GPIO, PWM, ADC, RTC, CAN, I2C, SPI, and UART. These libraries aim to simplify the development process for projects involving STM32 microcontrollers by providing a set of easy-to-use interfaces for the aforementioned peripherals.

**Features**:
GPIO: General Purpose Input/Output interface.
PWM: Pulse Width Modulation for controlling motors, LEDs, etc.
ADC: Analog to Digital Converter for sensor data reading.
RTC: Real-Time Clock for timekeeping tasks.
CAN: Controller Area Network for automotive applications.
I2C: Inter-Integrated Circuit for serial communication.
SPI: Serial Peripheral Interface for fast serial communication.
UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter for serial communication.

**Prerequisites** :
Before using these libraries, ensure you have the following installed:
STM32CubeIDE or any compatible ARM development environment.
C++ compiler with C++11 support.
STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) drivers.

**Installation**:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  $git clone [https://github.com/tahir11shaikh/Stm32Class.git]
2.Include the library or libraries you need in your project.
3.Ensure the HAL drivers are correctly configured in your project settings.
